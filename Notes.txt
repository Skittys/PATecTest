Test was extremely vague and I didn't know what Cucumber/Gherkin were so had to do a bit of research about it.
Cucumber is apparently an open source tool that tests business-readable specs against coade (so puts it in english)

First things first, downloaded the MASTER zip that was included in the email -> Extreacted to local directory

Installed IntelliJ IDEA (1.2GB jeez!) with .java NOT .groovy
Installed Java SE 10.0.2
Installed Apache Maven 3.5.4 (Absolute headache)
Downloaded IntelliJ IDEA Cucumber for Java Plugin

IMPORTED BASE JAVA PROJECT:
Reimported all maven projects -> "Following module has incorrect" type message given -> Rebuilt
Using CMD, "ran mvn clean test" -> Build Success
Created testing directory and resources sub-directory -> set resources as Test Resources Root
Created techtest sub-directory within resources and created belly.feature file (This is just to learn the syntax)


===================================================================================================================
EXAMPLE STUFF
===================================================================================================================
BELLY.FEATURE: Created an example scenario about eating food

ADDING THE RUNNER: Have to create a java runner to run the feature tests
Created new Java class in techtest directory -> RunCuccTest.java
Threw an error -> Turns out SDK wasn't set -> Set to Java SE 10.0.2

ADDING THE STEP DEFINITIONS: New java class created -> StepDefinitions.java
Input the snippets given when running the testrunner
Add imports for given, when, then & pendingexception to fix errors
Create BELLY.JAVA

SOMETHING INTERESTING
===================================================================================================================
Ok so time to figure out what the hell I'm doing. I looked up API interrogation and got a stackoverflow post
asking WORD FOR WORD (literally copy pasted from the README) how to do this. Check it out here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45463338/testing-apis-with-gherkin-java-and-intellij-idea
(In my opinion and apparently this guy agrees, the specification is too vague)

===================================================================================================================
MAIN WORK
===================================================================================================================
Have a link to the API (http://turing.niallbunting.com:3001/) -> Assume that I must request it through intellij
Attempting to request a connect is REFUSED -> Try again

Host/port = the turing URL
ADD: Header -> Content-Type VALUE: application/json
SPECIFY PARAMETERS -> Song = /api/video & Playlist = /api/playlist
RESULTS IN: SERVER STATUS: 404
